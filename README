//Assignment 2

Extra Features: Press ‘p’ for ‘pause’. All input in “upper caps” work as well.


Information:
— Only the Camera is allowed to move while the game is paused or stopped.
— The tetris grid is always fully visible i.e. it is never perpendicular to the camera
— The set frame-rate is currently 3 fps (Set in the timer function in main.cpp)
— When the game stops because of grey tile collision, it can be restarted using “r” or “R”.
— The robotic arm can reach each and every position on the grid
— The tetris block attached to the robotic arm is snapped to the nearest cube

— Makefile works with main.cpp which includes Play.h, Shape.h and Robot.h
— Shape.h  defines the object (tetris tiles)
— Robot.h  defines the robot in the game
— Play.h defines keyboard functions and run sequence of the game
— Comments are included to explain the code’s working

— All the mentioned features in the assignment description have been tested and are working correctly as per my testing
